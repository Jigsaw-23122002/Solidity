/*
Integers in solidity is of two types -
1) int ---->signed integers
2) uint ---->unsigned integers

* signed integers are from int8 to int256
* unsigned integers are from uint8 to uint256
* default value of all the integers is 0
* int is alias to int256 and uint is alias to uint256
* the range of signed integer datatype is -2^(n-1) to 2^(n-1)-1;
* the range of unsigned integer datataype is 0 to 2^(n-1)-1;
* integer overflow concept in solidity is same as in cpp
