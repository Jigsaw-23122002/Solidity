## Smart Contract Compilation

Smart contract is the code written in solidity file having .sol as extension. Whenever the .sol file is passed through the solidity compiler, 2 things are generated - ABI (Abstract Binary Interface) and Byte Code. Byte Code is stored on to the ethereum blockchain. The ABI helps in the communication of any other smart contract with this particular smart contract.

Now compile the sample contract and we can see the ABI and Byte Code option which on copying and pasting in notepad looks something like -
